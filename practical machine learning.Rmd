## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

## The goal
The goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: [http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

Six young healthy participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:
* Class A - exactly according to the specification
* Class B - throwing the elbows to the front
* Class C - lifting the dumbbell only halfway
* Class D - lowering the dumbbell only halfway
* Class E - throwing the hips to the front

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. Researchers made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).



## Data

The training data for this project are available here:

[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)

The test data are available here:

[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

The data for this project come from this source: [http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)

## Load data



```{r }
downloadcsv <- function(url, nastrings) {
    temp <- tempfile()
    download.file(url, temp, method = "curl")
    data <- read.csv(temp, na.strings = nastrings)
    unlink(temp)
    return(data)
}

training.url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
train <- downloadcsv(training.url, c("", "NA", "#DIV/0!"))

test.url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
test <- downloadcsv(test.url, c("", "NA", "#DIV/0!"))

dim(train)
```
The training set has `r dim(train)[1]` observations of `r dim(train)[2]` variables


```{r }
dim(test)
```
The test set has `r dim(test)[1]` observations of `r dim(test)[2]` variables

The observations of each class

```{r }
table(train$classe)
```

## Preprocessing

### Partitioning the training set
We'll separate our training data into a training set and a validation set so that we can validate our model.
```{r }
library(caret)
set.seed(123456)
trainset <- createDataPartition(train$classe, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
Training <- train[trainset, ]
Validation <- train[-trainset, ]
```


##Feature selection
First we clean up near zero variance features, columns with missing values and descriptive fields.

```{r }
# exclude near zero variance features
nzvcol <- nearZeroVar(Training)
Training <- Training[, -nzvcol]

# exclude columns with m40% ore more missing values exclude descriptive
# columns like name etc
cntlength <- sapply(Training, function(x) {
    sum(!(is.na(x) | x == ""))
})
nullcol <- names(cntlength[cntlength < 0.6 * length(Training$classe)])
descriptcol <- c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", 
    "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_window")
excludecols <- c(descriptcol, nullcol)
Training <- Training[, !names(Training) %in% excludecols]
```

## Model Training

We will use random forest as our model
```{r }
library(randomForest)
rfModel <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = Training, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 10)
```



## Model Validation

### Training data set accuracy

```{r }
ptraining <- predict(rfModel, Training)
print(confusionMatrix(ptraining, Training$classe))
```

### Validation data set accuracy 

```{r }
pvalidation <- predict(rfModel, Validation)
print(confusionMatrix(pvalidation, Validation$classe))
```


## Prediction

```{r }
ptest <- predict(rfModel, test)
ptest
```
